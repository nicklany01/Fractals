# Fractals Project

## Overview

This project showcases the implementation of two fascinating fractals: the Sierpiński carpet and the Burning Ship fractal. It leverages the power of PyTorch for efficient computation and parallelism.

### Sierpiński Carpet

The Sierpiński carpet is a plane fractal first described by Wacław Sierpiński in 1916. It is a generalization of the Cantor set to two dimensions and is constructed by recursively removing the central part of a square, leaving a pattern that resembles a carpet.

### Burning Ship Fractal

The Burning Ship fractal is a complex and visually captivating fractal that generates intricate patterns. Unlike the Mandelbrot set, the Burning Ship fractal is characterized by its distinctive ship-like shapes and patterns. This project uses PyTorch to compute the fractal, leveraging its parallelism capabilities for efficient computation.

## Fractal Descriptions

### Sierpiński Carpet

The Sierpiński carpet is generated by the following process:

1. Start with a solid square.
2. Divide the square into nine smaller congruent squares in a 3x3 grid.
3. Remove the central square.
4. Repeat the process for each of the remaining smaller squares.

### Burning Ship Fractal

The Burning Ship fractal is generated by iterating the function:

$$
z\_{n+1} = (|Re(z_n)| + i \cdot |Im(z_n)|)^2 + c
$$

where \( z \) is a complex number and \( c \) is a constant complex parameter. The fractal is visualized based on the number of iterations before the values escape to infinity.
