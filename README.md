# Burning Ship Fractal

## Overview

The Burning Ship Fractal is a complex and visually captivating fractal that generates intricate patterns. Unlike the Mandelbrot set, the Burning Ship fractal is characterized by its distinctive ship-like shapes and patterns. This project uses PyTorch to compute the fractal, leveraging its parallelism capabilities for efficient computation.

## Fractal Description

The Burning Ship fractal is generated by iterating the function:

\[ z\_{n+1} = (|Re(z_n)| + i \cdot |Im(z_n)|)^2 + c \]

where \( z \) is a complex number and \( c \) is a constant complex parameter. The fractal is visualized based on the number of iterations before the values escape to infinity.
